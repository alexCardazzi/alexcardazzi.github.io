Formulation of an efficient transportation infrastructure policy requires information about factors affecting road and traffic conditions. We generate the first causal evidence that decreasing pavement quality increases vehicle crash rates and decreases average speed. Results from instrumental variable models and parallel-segment regressions using spatially and temporally disaggregated data from Federal-Aid Highway System (FAHS) roads in California show statistically and economically significant increases in vehicle crash rates and decreases in average vehicle speed caused by road damage. These impacts imply significant increases in social costs attributable to road damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould More “Trust The Process” of Tanking? (Contemporary Economic Policy, 2025)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Eduardo G. Minuci & Candon Johnson (link)\nAbstract: To address concerns with competitive balance in the NBA, the worst-performing teams in a season are compensated with a higher probability of earning a top draft pick. This system creates incentives for teams to lose on purpose, or “tank,” if they do not perceive they have a chance of making the playoffs and winning championships. We evaluate if tanking is an effective approach to improve team (on-court and financial) outcomes by examining the most explicit tanking case in the NBA: the “Trust the Process” Philadelphia 76ers. Using a synthetic control approach, we demonstrate that The Process indeed caused the 76ers to be more successful in terms of winning and operating income by the end of the sample. However, we also calculate discounted present values of the outcome measures, and only operating income had a plausibly positive present value at the time of Hinke’s hiring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand For Offense: Designated Hitters and MLB Attendance (Applied Economics, 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Zachary Rodriguez (link)\nAbstract: In 2022, Major League Baseball changed its rules to include the designated hitter position in both the American and National Leagues. Up until that year, designated hitters were only used by American League teams. This rule change creates an environment where half of a major sports league is given a shock to offensive production. We analyze the demand for offense by investigating how the designated hitter affects attendance and offensive production for National League teams. Our results contribute to a rich literature that analyzes how offense affects fan participation, as we provide the first evidence using causal inference that offense increases fan attendance. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we show that the offense created by a designated hitter increases attendance by about 3.5-7.9% at National League home games as a result of the rule change. Given a point estimate increase in total offense of about 4.85%, we find evidence that attendance is likely elastic with respect to total offense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Career Discrimination in Professional Basketball: Evidence From the Hall of Fame (International Journal of Sport Finance, 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Brad R Humphreys & Alexandre Olbrecht (link)\nAbstract: Economic research on racial discrimination frequently employs data from sports. We analyze admission decisions for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame (HOF) for evidence of discrimination against star black National Basketball Association (NBA) players from the 1950s to 2010s. Results from a Probit regression model explaining observed HOF admissions show that, holding career performance constant, star black NBA players are 1 to 2 percentage points less likely to be admitted than non-black players. The anonymous electors to the HOF appear to act on discriminatory preferences. Like the results in the NBA salary discrimination literature, this effect disappeared in the 1980s and 1990s, and reappeared after the 2000s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSports Team Success and Managerial Decisions: The Role of Playing Time Concentration (International Journal of Sports Marketing and Sponsorship, 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Brad R Humphreys & Kole Reddig (link)\nAbstract: Professional sports teams employ highly paid managers and coaches to train players and make tactical and strategic team decisions. A large literature analyzes the impact of manager decisions on team outcomes. Empirical analysis of manager decisions requires a quantifiable proxy variable for manager decisions. Previous research focused on manager dismissals, tenure on teams, the number of substitutions made in games, or the number of healthy players on rosters held out of games for rest, generally finding small positive impacts of manager decisions on team success. We analyze manager decisions by developing a novel measure their game-specific influence, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of playing-time across players on a team roster in a game. Evidence from two way fixed effects regression models explaining observed variation in National Basketball Association team winning percentage over the 1999-2000 to 2018-2019 seasons show a significant association between managers allocation of playing time and team success. A one standard deviation change in playing-time HHI that reflects a flattened distribution of player talent is associated with between one and two additional wins per season, holding the talent of players on the team roster constant. Heterogeneity exists in the impact across teams with different player talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Shocks and Celebrity Exposure: The Effect of “Magic” Johnson on AIDS Diagnoses and Mortality in the US (Health Economics, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Joshua C Martin & Zachary Rodriguez (link)\nAbstract: We present evidence that Earvin “Magic” Johnson’s announcement that he contracted HIV served as a public-health catalyst for rapidly correcting the public’s understanding of who was at risk of infection. Using a novel identification strategy, we present evidence that there was a large but temporary increase in the number of AIDS diagnoses for heterosexual men following the announcement. This effect was concentrated in areas with greater prior exposure to Johnson. We show that these men were both more likely to have been diagnosed via a formal blood test and less likely to die within 1 decade of their initial diagnosis—suggesting that Johnson’s announcement caused an intertemporal substitution in testing which prolonged patients’ lifespans as a result of earlier access to medical care. We estimate that Johnson’s announcement caused approximately 800 additional heterosexual males in the United States in metropolitan statistical areas with National Basketball Association franchises men to discover their underlying AIDS diagnosis and, of whom, were more likely to live at least 1 decade beyond their initial diagnosis date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Sporting Events Amplify Airborne Virus Transmission? Causal Evidence from US Professional Team Sports (Sports Economics Review, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Brad R Humphreys, Jane E Ruseski, Brian P Soebbing, & Nicholas Watanabe (link)\nAbstract: We analyze the impact of professional sporting events on local seasonal influenza mortality to develop evidence on the role played by spectator attendance at sporting events in airborne virus transmission. Results from a difference-in-differences model applied to data from a sample of US cities that gained new professional sports teams over the period 1962–2016 show that the presence of games in these cities increased local influenza mortality by between 4% and 24%, depending on the sport, relative to cities with no professional sports teams and relative to mortality in those cities before a new team arrived. Influenza mortality fell in cities with teams in some years when work stoppages occurred in sports leagues. Health policy decisions, and decisions about the subsidization of professional sports, should take into account the role played by sporting events in increasing airborne virus transmission and local influenza and coronavirus mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic freedom and one-way truck rental prices: An empirical note (American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Robert A Lawson (link)\nAbstract: This study examines the one-way truck rental prices for 378 cities. There are large price differentials in one-way rental prices between city pairs. The pull of people toward higher economic freedom locales and push away from lower economic freedom locales is found to be an important determinant of the city-pair price differentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMass Gathering Sport Events and the Spread of Viral Respiratory Infection: Japanese Professional Baseball and Influenza (Journal of Sports Economics, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Hiroaki Funahashi & Nicholas Masafumi Watanabe (link)\nAbstract: Using weekly-level influenza case data from all 47 prefectures in Japan alongside data from Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league from 1999 to 2018, we examine the effect of hosting games on local influenza transmission. The results highlight that during the flu season, for every NPB game held at its home ballpark, there is an average increase of 0.18 cases per sentinel medical institution (SMI) between that week and the following week. The effects are robust to different specifications and placebo tests. This translates to about a 0.1% increase in the number of cases during the overlap of NPB and flu seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional Cues and Violent Behavior: Unexpected Basketball Losses Increase Incidents of Family Violence (The Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Bryan C McCannon, Brad R Humphreys, & Zachary Rodriguez (link)\nAbstract: Domestic violence generates long-term effects on offenders, victims, and other household members. While coercive behavior explains some family violence, aggression can also be reactive, triggered by emotional stimulus. Insight into triggers of family violence can inform policy and mitigate abusive behavior. Card, D. and G. B. Dahl. (2011). “Family Violence and Football: The Effect of Unexpected Emotional Cues on Violent Behavior,” 126 The Quarterly Journal of Economics 103–43 undertook a novel analysis of family violence triggers using unexpected losses by American professional football teams. We extend research on this trigger using data from National Basketball Association (NBA) games. Our results show that unexpected NBA losses lead to increased in-home violence. Heterogeneity analyses show that these effects are larger for weekend games, when referees are fatigued, and closer to the playoff season. (JEL J44, K42, Z22).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Satisfaction and Stock Returns during the COVID-19 Pandemic (Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Mary Becker & Zachary McGurk (link)\nAbstract: The COVID-19 Pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on how employees and employers operate. Employees, directly affected by workplace changes, may provide information regarding future efficiencies. As a result, crowdsourced employee satisfaction (ES) reviews mentioning the COVID-19 Pandemic may contain useful information regarding the future profitability of these firms. We utilize crowdsourced COVID-19 Pandemic specific ES obtained from Glassdoor.com to determine the impact on abnormal stock returns for public firms from March–December 2020. We find evidence that higher COVID-19 ES is related to higher abnormal stock returns. While non-COVID ES is found not to be related to abnormal stock returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReadership and Citations as Alternative Measures of Impact (Constitutional Political Economy, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Roger D Congleton & Alex Marsella (link)\nAbstract: This paper undertakes a statistical analysis of citations and readership of papers published in the journal Constitutional Political Economy. Its focus is not the usual attempt to assess the relative impact of articles or authors but rather to suggest that readership (downloads) is a more general measure of impact and one that should be given more attention. Downloads are not simply a product of citations; nor are citations a simple product of downloads. They are distinct measures of impact. Papers and authors are evidently judged one at a time by their readers and by those who subsequently cite papers that they have read."

This study estimates the strategy’s amenity value using property transactions and variation in Stop & Frisk activity resulting from the trial. Results indicate prices increased by 5% for properties most exposed to Stop & Frisk, relative to nearby properties, once the NYPD was ordered to cease Stop & Frisk. Importantly, housing prices seem to have only responded to changes along the extensive margin of Stop & Frisk, not the intensive margin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSport Stadiums & Land Values (Submitted)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Hiroaki Funahashi (link)\nAbstract: The construction of a sports stadium requires substantial resources and generates sweeping spillovers onto its surrounding community. With public funds being used more frequently, and in growing sums, to finance stadium construction, it is becoming increasingly important that policymakers and community leaders understand how residents value stadiums. This study explores the local property value effects of 27 different stadium projects in Japan over almost three decades. The findings, which are supported by multiple difference-in-differences (DiD) estimators and found in multiple datasets, suggest that stadiums increase the value of nearby properties. Effects are strongest for the closest parcels and for stadiums designed for long-term use by professional teams (as opposed to large athletic stadiums primarily built for one-off events). This research advances the literature by comprehensively studying a novel setting using modern DiD techniques and high-quality data, offering new insights for urban planners and policymakers considering future sports facility investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurder in the Marketplace (Submitted)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Zachary Porreca & Victoria Biagi (link)\nAbstract: Violence is often viewed as an intrinsic feature of illicit markets, driven by competition, disputes, and predation. We argue that the connection between violence and markets is not exclusive to illicit markets and that in the absence of strong institutions these factors exist ubiquitously. Using an estimator of spatial concentration, we document the empirical relationship between violence and markets in the 14 th century. We then employ a large language model to analyze the coroner’s accounts of the era’s homicides, finding that many of these incidents were driven by avoidable escalations of business-related disputes. Employing a novel difference-indifferences estimator for spatial concentration, we proceed to causally identify the impacts of the introduction of London’s first professional police force in the 19 th century on this concentration. We find that the police force’s introduction led to a 54% reduction in the degree of concentration of violence around marketplaces. Our findings suggest that it is not the nature of the commodities being sold in illicit markets that drives violence, but is rather the absence of formal institutions of enforcement and dispute resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fault in the Stars: Exploring Employee Sentiment and Stock Returns through Textual Analysis (Submitted)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Mary J Becker & Zachary McGurk (link)\nAbstract: Prior research has used Glassdoor.com’s five-star rating system to measure employee satisfaction and explore its relationship to stock returns. We demonstrate how, due to a 2012 internal Glassdoor.com policy change, this crowd sourced data suffers from abnormalities that limits its usefulness. To account for these issues, we employ textual analysis via multinominal inverse regression to create monthly firm-specific satisfaction measures for public US firms from 2009-2019. We find evidence that using raw star ratings biases coefficient estimates toward zero in both cross-sectional and portfolio analyses, implying the relationship between employee satisfaction and abnormal returns may be understated in the literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicromobilty and Traffic Safety (In Progress)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Margaret Bock, Jonathan Hall, & Conor Lennon (link)\nAbstract: .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessaging and Driving: Unintended Consequences of Dynamic Message Signs in Virginia (Working Paper)\n\n\n\n\n\n(link)\nAbstract: Traffic fatalities accounted for 1.3% of all deaths in the United States in 2017 and the average American lost about 100 hours due to congestion in 2019. One tool transportation departments (DOTs) use to address these issues is Dynamic Message Signs (DMS). DMS convey traffic conditions and occasional safety reminders to drivers in order to increase attentiveness and reduce harmful behavior. This study leverages variation in the text and formatting of messages displayed by Virginia’s DMS to explain detailed speed and crash data near DMS. This study reports no significant differences in crash risk nor speed when DMS display safety messages compared to default messages. However, this study does uncover large and signficant differences in crash risk and speed when DMS transition, or cycle, between multiple messages, although the effect only lasts for 3-5 kilometers. Results indicate that multi-page messages increased crashes by 1.5% in 2019, and reduced vehicle speed around DMS by 2-4%, relative to single page messages. Although DMS can provide valuable, actionable information to drivers, DOTs should be more selective in the timing and formatting of messages as to not impose additional externalities on drivers."

We analyze manager decisions by developing a novel measure their game-specific influence, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of playing-time across players on a team roster in a game. Evidence from two way fixed effects regression models explaining observed variation in National Basketball Association team winning percentage over the 1999-2000 to 2018-2019 seasons show a significant association between managers allocation of playing time and team success. A one standard deviation change in playing-time HHI that reflects a flattened distribution of player talent is associated with between one and two additional wins per season, holding the talent of players on the team roster constant. Heterogeneity exists in the impact across teams with different player talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Shocks and Celebrity Exposure: The Effect of “Magic” Johnson on AIDS Diagnoses and Mortality in the US (Health Economics, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Joshua C Martin & Zachary Rodriguez (link)\nAbstract: We present evidence that Earvin “Magic” Johnson’s announcement that he contracted HIV served as a public-health catalyst for rapidly correcting the public’s understanding of who was at risk of infection. Using a novel identification strategy, we present evidence that there was a large but temporary increase in the number of AIDS diagnoses for heterosexual men following the announcement. This effect was concentrated in areas with greater prior exposure to Johnson. We show that these men were both more likely to have been diagnosed via a formal blood test and less likely to die within 1 decade of their initial diagnosis—suggesting that Johnson’s announcement caused an intertemporal substitution in testing which prolonged patients’ lifespans as a result of earlier access to medical care. We estimate that Johnson’s announcement caused approximately 800 additional heterosexual males in the United States in metropolitan statistical areas with National Basketball Association franchises men to discover their underlying AIDS diagnosis and, of whom, were more likely to live at least 1 decade beyond their initial diagnosis date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Sporting Events Amplify Airborne Virus Transmission? Causal Evidence from US Professional Team Sports (Sports Economics Review, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Brad R Humphreys, Jane E Ruseski, Brian P Soebbing, & Nicholas Watanabe (link)\nAbstract: We analyze the impact of professional sporting events on local seasonal influenza mortality to develop evidence on the role played by spectator attendance at sporting events in airborne virus transmission. Results from a difference-in-differences model applied to data from a sample of US cities that gained new professional sports teams over the period 1962–2016 show that the presence of games in these cities increased local influenza mortality by between 4% and 24%, depending on the sport, relative to cities with no professional sports teams and relative to mortality in those cities before a new team arrived. Influenza mortality fell in cities with teams in some years when work stoppages occurred in sports leagues. Health policy decisions, and decisions about the subsidization of professional sports, should take into account the role played by sporting events in increasing airborne virus transmission and local influenza and coronavirus mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic freedom and one-way truck rental prices: An empirical note (American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Robert A Lawson (link)\nAbstract: This study examines the one-way truck rental prices for 378 cities. There are large price differentials in one-way rental prices between city pairs. The pull of people toward higher economic freedom locales and push away from lower economic freedom locales is found to be an important determinant of the city-pair price differentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMass Gathering Sport Events and the Spread of Viral Respiratory Infection: Japanese Professional Baseball and Influenza (Journal of Sports Economics, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Hiroaki Funahashi & Nicholas Masafumi Watanabe (link)\nAbstract: Using weekly-level influenza case data from all 47 prefectures in Japan alongside data from Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league from 1999 to 2018, we examine the effect of hosting games on local influenza transmission. The results highlight that during the flu season, for every NPB game held at its home ballpark, there is an average increase of 0.18 cases per sentinel medical institution (SMI) between that week and the following week. The effects are robust to different specifications and placebo tests. This translates to about a 0.1% increase in the number of cases during the overlap of NPB and flu seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional Cues and Violent Behavior: Unexpected Basketball Losses Increase Incidents of Family Violence (The Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Bryan C McCannon, Brad R Humphreys, & Zachary Rodriguez (link)\nAbstract: Domestic violence generates long-term effects on offenders, victims, and other household members. While coercive behavior explains some family violence, aggression can also be reactive, triggered by emotional stimulus. Insight into triggers of family violence can inform policy and mitigate abusive behavior. Card, D. and G. B. Dahl. (2011). “Family Violence and Football: The Effect of Unexpected Emotional Cues on Violent Behavior,” 126 The Quarterly Journal of Economics 103–43 undertook a novel analysis of family violence triggers using unexpected losses by American professional football teams. We extend research on this trigger using data from National Basketball Association (NBA) games. Our results show that unexpected NBA losses lead to increased in-home violence. Heterogeneity analyses show that these effects are larger for weekend games, when referees are fatigued, and closer to the playoff season. (JEL J44, K42, Z22).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Satisfaction and Stock Returns during the COVID-19 Pandemic (Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Mary Becker & Zachary McGurk (link)\nAbstract: The COVID-19 Pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on how employees and employers operate. Employees, directly affected by workplace changes, may provide information regarding future efficiencies. As a result, crowdsourced employee satisfaction (ES) reviews mentioning the COVID-19 Pandemic may contain useful information regarding the future profitability of these firms. We utilize crowdsourced COVID-19 Pandemic specific ES obtained from Glassdoor.com to determine the impact on abnormal stock returns for public firms from March–December 2020. We find evidence that higher COVID-19 ES is related to higher abnormal stock returns. While non-COVID ES is found not to be related to abnormal stock returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReadership and Citations as Alternative Measures of Impact (Constitutional Political Economy, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Roger D Congleton & Alex Marsella (link)\nAbstract: This paper undertakes a statistical analysis of citations and readership of papers published in the journal Constitutional Political Economy. Its focus is not the usual attempt to assess the relative impact of articles or authors but rather to suggest that readership (downloads) is a more general measure of impact and one that should be given more attention. Downloads are not simply a product of citations; nor are citations a simple product of downloads. They are distinct measures of impact. Papers and authors are evidently judged one at a time by their readers and by those who subsequently cite papers that they have read."

    "text": "All Materials Here\n\n\n\n\n\n#What is R? R is an open source (OSS), object oriented scripting language. It is mostly used by data scientists as an enviornment for statistical computing and graphics. Its source code is written in C, Fortran and R, though it stems from the mostly defunct language S. R, as a language, ranks 12th in terms of overall popularity (according to TIOBE 2019). Due to this, the answer to nearly any question you might have about R is on Google. Specifically, Stack Overflow, RStudio’s Community Website, or a Reddit Community ( r/rstats, r/Rlanguage ) should have what you are looking for. The hardest part about programming is knowing what and how to google.\nFor those of you who are curious, R is different from STATA in a few ways though ultimately minor. In my opinion, R has a steeper learning curve but it is more flexible and powerful once you are over that hump.\nWhen using R, most people use RStudio. I like to think of R as the brain and RStudio as the body. It is likely that you will never use the default R GUI (Graphical User Interface) alone.\n#Download R To download R, follow this link. R asks that you to choose a location close to you when you download. Then, you can select the R that works for your operating system.1 Then, click on Install R for the first time. Finally, Download whatever version of R is displayed. Download R before RStudio!\n#Download RStudio#### To download RStudio, go here. This should detect what OS you have and make the appropriate suggestion. However, in the event that the suggestion is incorrect, scrolling down will reveal other versions you can download.\n\nHere, we can see four distinct panels. The bottom left is the console. This is where you can view your code’s output. I also use this for “test code” I do not want in my saved file. The top left is where you write code that you want to save, which we’ll call a script. The upper right is your enviornment (along with history and connections, which we will not discuss right now). This is where you can see all the data you have loaded or created. The bottom right is where you can view plots, view files and use the help functionality. The help in R is an excellent start.\nTo use help, type in a question mark and then the function you need with into the console and hit enter. For example, type ?mean and check out what pops up. There will be information on Usage, Arguments, and Examples.\n#Data Structures####\nSome basic objects, or data structures, in R are as follows:\n\nLogical: TRUE or FALSE\nIntegers: 0L, 1L, 2L, ..., .Machine$integer.max\nDoubles: .Machine$double.xmin, ..., 0, ..., .Machine$double.xmax\nCharacters: \"Alex\", \"Econometrics\", \"Radiohead\"\nFactors: Think of these as categories. Represented numerically in R.\nVectors: A collection of anything above, but all must be of the same type.\nMatrices: A collection of vectors, all of the same type.\nLists: A collection of any of the previous objects, though does not have to be of the same type.\nData Frames: A more general form of a matrix, but a special case of a list. Arguably the most used structure in R, especially for economists running regressions.\nMissing, Empty Data: When data is missing it is displayed as NA and when data is empty it is NULL. NA values are extremely common in economic research data, and it is important to know how to handle these.\n\n#Logic Before the development of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), most notably C++, programming languages were more focused on logic instead of data. Even now with OOP, logic plays a big part in how programs are written. Here are some examples of how the “and” (&) and “or” (|) operators work in tandem with logical values. Next, we can also use inequalities like in written math, and these will be evaluated the way you might expect.\n\nA note about the semicolon used throughout this tutorial: this is just so the code is more concise. You do not need to end a line with a semicolon (like how you would in C++), but it allows you can put two lines onto one line if you separate them with a semicolon. I only ever do this if I have multiple, short lines that “go together”. Here it is purely aesthetic.\n\n\nTRUE & TRUE; TRUE & FALSE; FALSE & FALSE;\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nTRUE | TRUE; TRUE | FALSE; FALSE | FALSE;\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n5 < 3; 5 > 3; 5 <= 3; 5 >= 3; 5 == 3; 5 != 3\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nHint: All numerical values, except 0, are coded as TRUE. I would hesitate using this unless you have binary variables that you have coded as 1/0 instead of TRUE/FALSE as it is unintuitive.\n\n\n1 & 5; 5 & 0\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n#Arithmetic Since we aren’t interested in just logic, we can also use R as a calculator. An incredibly elaborate calculator, but a calculator nonetheless. Typical mathematical operators are what you would expect in R. +, -, *, / are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division respectively. Other useful operators are integer division (%/%) , modulo (%%), and exponents (^ or **). Integer division chops off the remainder after division and modulo returns the remainder after division.\n\n\n1 + 2; 3 - 4; 5 * 6; 7 / 8; 5%/%3; 5%%3\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n[1] -1\n\n\n[1] 30\n\n\n[1] 0.875\n\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n#Variables / Objects Further, because we aren’t necessarily interested in just incredibly elaborate calculators, we can explore how to store data in R. Much like algebra, we can use characters, or strings of characters, to represent values. We can do this with three operators: <-, ->, =. The first two are identical besides the way they “push” data, though the first is strictly more popular than the second. The final one is different, but in a nuanced way which is beyond the scope of this tutorial.2\n\n\nx <- 1 + 1; y <- 2 + 2\nprint(x); print(y)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n[1] 4\n\n#I am going to create a variable that is the sum of two other variables:\nx + y -> z; print(z)\n\n[1] 6\n\n#notice how changing the value of x does not change z.  This may not be trivial but it is good to note.\nx <- 100; print(z)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\nTypically, printing things in R is done with the print() function. However, if one is working in RStudio, just calling the actual variable will print it to the console just the same. Unless you are building a larger program that would require printing, this is not necessary to think about. Though, often times, printing is a good debugging tool when developing any script. Moreover, I encourage litering your scripts with print statements while you are learning.\n#Vectors Rarely do we work with single values. Instead, we have collections of data, or variables, which we will consider vectors. The first thing to know is c(). This stands for concatenate, and it is very important. Essentially, it coerces multiple values into a vector. The rep() function repeats the first agument passed the number of times specified by the second argument passed. The seq() function creates a sequence between the first two arguments passed with the third arguement being the level of incrimentation. Lastly, in this code block, we see how to subset vectors by indexing and by logic.\n\n\n#Note how we do not need to type every integer here by using the colon\nc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); c(1:5)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nrep(1, 10); rep(c(1:5), 10)\n\n [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\n [1] 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3\n[39] 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5\n\nseq(1, 10, 2); seq(1, 10, .1)\n\n[1] 1 3 5 7 9\n\n\n [1]  1.0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.5  1.6  1.7  1.8  1.9  2.0  2.1  2.2  2.3  2.4\n[16]  2.5  2.6  2.7  2.8  2.9  3.0  3.1  3.2  3.3  3.4  3.5  3.6  3.7  3.8  3.9\n[31]  4.0  4.1  4.2  4.3  4.4  4.5  4.6  4.7  4.8  4.9  5.0  5.1  5.2  5.3  5.4\n[46]  5.5  5.6  5.7  5.8  5.9  6.0  6.1  6.2  6.3  6.4  6.5  6.6  6.7  6.8  6.9\n[61]  7.0  7.1  7.2  7.3  7.4  7.5  7.6  7.7  7.8  7.9  8.0  8.1  8.2  8.3  8.4\n[76]  8.5  8.6  8.7  8.8  8.9  9.0  9.1  9.2  9.3  9.4  9.5  9.6  9.7  9.8  9.9\n[91] 10.0\n\n\n\nNow that we can make vectors, we will want to manipulate them. We can do arithmetic and logical operations to vectors like we did to scalars before.\n\n\nx <- c(1:5)\nx > 2; x + 2; x*3; x + x\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n[1] 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\n[1]  3  6  9 12 15\n\n\n[1]  2  4  6  8 10\n\n\n\nSuppose now that we have a long vector but only want to look at, modify, remove, etc. only certain elements. We will use square brackets to do this.\n\n\n#Vector subsetting by indexing and logic\ny <- c(1:100)\ny[10:20] #by index, give me the 10th through 20th elements\n\n [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n\ny[y < 5] #by logic, give me the elements of y where y is less than 5\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n\ny[y %% 6 == 0] #by logic, give me the elements in y such that dividing them by 6 does not yield a remainder\n\n [1]  6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 66 72 78 84 90 96\n\nz <- c(x, y[90:100]); z #combining two vectors, x and a subset of y.\n\n [1]   1   2   3   4   5  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100\n\n\n\nAs an example, we can run some of these operations inside square brackets alone and get vectors of logical values. For example, we can use y %% 6 == 0 and get 100 TRUE or FALSE values. Sometimes, we want to know the indices where these are TRUE and we can use the which() function. This is an important function.\nYou might be able to see how this can become complicated. For example, suppose we had 3 vectors: GDP, Country, and Continent, and we only want the GDP for countries in Europe. It may look something like this:\n\n\nGDP <- c(47, 23, 61, 29, 80, 48, 92, 42)\nCountry <- c(\"USA\", \"Italy\", \"Egypt\", \"Mexico\", \"Japan\", \"UK\", \"Germany\", \"Brazil\")\nContinent <- c(\"NA\", \"EU\", \"AF\", \"NA\", \"AS\", \"EU\", \"EU\", \"SA\")\nprint(GDP[Continent == \"EU\"])\n\n[1] 23 48 92\n\n\n\nI like to think of it like: “Give me GDP where/given Continent equals EU”. Talk to yourself when you program! If you wanted continent to be equal to europe OR north america, this can be done like: Continent == \"EU\" | Continent == \"NA\" or Continent %in% c(\"EU\", \"NA\").\nOverall, vectors are of extreme interest to us. I want to take a moment to show some helpful, prebuilt statistical functions in R. For example, we can use mean(), sum(), sd(), var(), summary(), t.test(), etc. There are also normal distribution functions rnorm(), qnorm(), dnorm(), and pnorm().\n\n\nN <- 100\nset.seed(789) #this is so we can replicate randomness\nx <- rnorm(N, mean = 1, sd = 4)\ny <- rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 4)\nsummary(x)\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.

Typically, most data is held in data frames, but first it is valuable to look into matrices. We will begin with two vectors of 5 randomly generated numbers.\n\n\n#rnorm generates n numbers from a normal distribution ... use ?rnorm for help\n#rbind - combine by row, or stack on top\n#cbind - combine by column, or squish next to each other\nset.seed(456) #set.seed allows us to replicate randomness\nx1 <- rnorm(5); x1\n\n[1] -1.3435214  0.6217756  0.8008747 -1.3888924 -0.7143569\n\nx2 <- rnorm(5); x2\n\n[1] -0.3240611  0.6906430  0.2505479  1.0073523  0.5732347\n\nrbindEx <- rbind(x1, x2); rbindEx\n\n         [,1]      [,2]      [,3]      [,4]       [,5]\nx1 -1.3435214 0.6217756 0.8008747 -1.388892 -0.7143569\nx2 -0.3240611 0.6906430 0.2505479  1.007352  0.5732347\n\ncbindEx <- cbind(x1, x2); cbindEx\n\n             x1         x2\n[1,] -1.3435214 -0.3240611\n[2,]  0.6217756  0.6906430\n[3,]  0.8008747  0.2505479\n[4,] -1.3888924  1.0073523\n[5,] -0.7143569  0.5732347\n\nrbindEx * 10\n\n         [,1]     [,2]     [,3]      [,4]      [,5]\nx1 -13.435214 6.217756 8.008747 -13.88892 -7.143569\nx2  -3.240611 6.906430 2.505479  10.07352  5.732347\n\n\n\nNow, we have created two matrices with our data. You can transpose them (t()), multiply them (%*%) or invert them (solve()). Instead of going too far into matrices, we’re going to move onto lists.\n#Lists Lists are a super flexible way to collect things. Here is an example of a list:\n\nx <- list(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"),\n          \"d\",\n          list(1,\n               c(2, 3),\n               \"alex\")\n          )\n\nHere, my list x has three elements. There is a character vector, a character element and then another list all together. To access the elements of a list, we need a double square bracket like x[[1]] which will yield the entire vector c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"). x[[1]][1] will yield \"a\".\nWe can also name elements in a list and use these to access certain elements.3\n\n\natm <- list(\n  \n  balance = c(5, 2, 3),\n  name = list(\n    first = c(\"alex\", \"bryan\", \"brad\"),\n    last = c(\"cardazzi\", \"mccannon\", \"humphreys\")\n    ),\n  favoriteSport = c(\"basketball\", \"nascar\", \"wvu football\")\n  )\n\natm$favoriteSport\n\n[1] \"basketball\"   \"nascar\"       \"wvu football\"\n\natm$name$first\n\n[1] \"alex\"  \"bryan\" \"brad\" \n\natm[[2]][[1]]\n\n[1] \"alex\"  \"bryan\" \"brad\" \n\n\n\nYou might imagine taking this list and converting it into something that looks like a table. This is where data frames come in.\n#Data Frames\nData frames are just a special case of a list. In a data frame, you should think of a matrix, or an excel sheet, where each column has a name. Typically, we read in data from CSV, Excel, JSON files, etc. In this tutorial, I will strictly use CSV files. Here is how to save your excel files as CSVs if you are unsure how. I am going to use this file called knicks.csv and it can be found here. We will talk more about reading data into R later.\n\n\nknicks <- read.csv(\"C:/Users/alexc/Desktop/Empirical Workshop/data/knicks.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\ndim(knicks) #returns the rows and columns of a data frame\n\n[1] 23 10\n\nhead(knicks) #head will display the first 6 rows just so you can take a peak at the data\n\n  No.                    Player Pos     Ht Ht_inches  Wt       Birth.Date  X\n1   0   Kadeem Allen\\\\allenka01  SG  1-Jun        73 200  January 15 1993 us\n2  31      Ron Baker\\\\bakerro01  SG  4-Jun        76 220    March 30 1993 us\n3  23     Trey Burke\\\\burketr01  PG Jun-00        73 175 November 12 1992 us\n4  21 Damyean Dotson\\\\dotsoda01  SG  5-Jun        77 202       May 6 1994 us\n5  13 Henry Ellenson\\\\ellenhe01  PF 10-Jun        82 240  January 13 1997 us\n6   3  Billy Garrett\\\\garrebi01  SG  6-Jun        78 213  October 16 1994 us\n  Exp        College\n1   1        Arizona\n2   2  Wichita State\n3   5       Michigan\n4   1 Oregon Houston\n5   2      Marquette\n6   R         DePaul\n\n\n\nWe used square brackets when subsetting vector, and we will do the same here. However, there are two dimensions (rows and columns) as opposed to the one dimensional vectors before. To obtain just the weight column, we can do knicks$Wt. To get the weight of players who did not attend college, we can do knicks$Wt[knicks$College == \"\"]. Note the column knicks$Exp. There are numbers but all of them have quotes around them. This is because some players have an “R” in their row, which means the player is a rookie and this is their first year in the NBA. In other words, if there is a vector of all numeric elements and one character elements, the whole vector will be converted to a character. You can force a vector to be numeric by as.numeric(). Here, the “R” will be removed for an NA, since the program can turn \"9\" into 9, but gets confused trying to convert \"R\" into a number.\n\nHomework 1\nFor this homework, use knicks.csv. Try your best not to “hard code” anything. For example, there are 23 Knicks players, but try not to type the number 23 in your code. This is to keep the script as flexible as possible, incase you had to repeat this code for a completely different roster list. Use View(knicks) to look at the dataset.\n\nFind the average weight of the Knicks roster.\nFind the range of the weights.\nFind the standard deviation of the weights.\nCalculate the standard deviation of the weights without using either sd() or var().\nTest if there is a significant difference in the weights of point guards & shooting guards relative to the rest of the players. Hint: point guard = PG, shooting guard = SG in the Pos. column.\nTest if guards (PG, SG) tend to have lower jersey numbers than other positions, but remove the centers (C).\nFind the average experience of the players.\nGenerate a vector of the names of the 5 least heavy players\nGenerate a vector of the names of the 5 heaviest players\nDrop the rows where players did not go to college or they are foreign. Save this as knicks2\nDrop the College column from the dataset.\nCheck if there is a significant correlation between jersey number and experience.\nMake a correlation matrix for weight, jersey number and experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThese tutorials assume you have Windows. The differences in Mac, Windows, Linux mostly have to do with reading in data since file paths are different. For example, in Windows, you might see a file path like C:/Users/alexc/Documents whereas on a Mac it might look like ~/Documents. We will cover this later.↩︎\nIf you are interested, a link↩︎\nThis is a good example of when to use <- vs =. Take “balance” as an example. The equal sign will make “balance” exist inside the list, but not in our Global Enviornment window pane. Instead, I could have written balance <- c(5, 2, 3) but this would have saved balance inside the atm list and in our Global Enviornment. Usually, this is not desired, but there may be occasions.↩︎"

    "text": "In the NBA, players are awarded MVP, DPOY, etc. by a voting system run by sports writers (formerly, voting was done by players). For the MVP in particular, writers vote for first through fifth places. 10 points are assigned for a first place vote, 8 points for a second place vote, and so on.\nFollowing the 2015-16 NBA season, Stephen Curry became the first ever unanimous MVP of the league. The most amount of points a player could have gotten that year was 1310 since there were 131 voting media members. The second place finisher, Kawhi Leonard, scored 634 points via some combination of second through fifth place votes. Kawhi’s point total was 48.4% of the total possible points.\nIf we use our imagination, we can think of Kawhi’s season amounting to 48.4% of an MVP season, or 0.484 MVPs. If we sum all of Kawhi’s MVP percentages over his career, he would net an expected 1.16 MVPs.\nI collected data from the 1955-1956 through the 2022-2023 NBA & ABA seasons. For each major NBA/ABA award, we can figure out each player’s expected total. This should not be taken too seriously, but rather be seen as a fun exploration."

    "text": "For this question, you will have to put together two sets of data. First, you will use college/university statistics from 1995’s issue of US News and World Report (data, documentation). Second, you will use earnings data of students from a variety of colleges/universities from College Scorecard (data, documentation).\n\nRead in the US News and World Report data. Save it as a data frame called usnwr.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Write your code here.\n\n\n\nRead in the College Scorecard data into a data frame called scorecard.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Write your code here.\n\n\n\nThe College Scorecard data represents outcomes for students who a) received federal financial aid and b) began as undergraduates at the institution ten years prior. Therefore, College Scorecard data from year \\(Y\\) can be matched to US News and World Report data from \\(Y-10\\). Unfortunately, the earliest year of Scorecard data is from 2007 while the US News and World Report data is from 1995. For simplification purposes, merge earnings_med from the 2007 Scorecard data into the 1995 US News and World Report Data. It might be easiest to eliminate all non-2007 data from scorecard before merging.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Write your code here.\n\n\n\nGenerate a summary statistics table for median student earnings, whether the school is private, the acceptance rate, size of the student body, student/faculty ratio, and instructional expenditure per student.

    "text": "Question 2\nIn the early 2000s, two economists ran an experiment where they sent fictitious resumes in response to job ads in Chicago and Boston. The authors varied the qualities of the fictitious resumes as well as the names on the resumes. Some resumes were given stereotypically white-sounding names (Emily, Brendan) and others African-American-sounding names (Lakisha, Jamal).1\nIn this part of the homework, we are going to investigate whether employers engage in racial discrimination when sifting through resumes using data collected by the researchers (data; documentation).2\n\nRead the data into a data frame called resume.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Write your code here.\n\n\n\nCreate the following binary variables:\n\nA variable called chicago that is equal to one if city is equal to “chicago” and zero otherwise.\nA variable called female that is equal to one if gender is equal to “female” and zero otherwise.\nA variable called black that is equal to one if ethnicity is equal to “afam” and zero otherwise.\nA variable called callback equal to one if call is equal to “yes” and zero otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Write your code here.\n\n\n\nEstimate and display the coefficients (using summary() is fine) of the following regression:\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\\text{Callback}_i = \\ &\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Jobs}_i + \\beta_2 \\text{Experience}_i + \\beta_3 \\text{Female}_i \\\\&+ \\beta_4 \\text{Chicago}_i + \\beta_5 \\text{Black}_i+ \\epsilon_i\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nCode\n# Write your code here.\n\n\n\nInterpret each coefficient in words.\n\nWrite your response here.\n\nCan we interpret these results causally?

    "text": "In the NBA, players are awarded MVP, DPOY, etc. by a voting system run by sports writers (formerly, voting was done by players). For the MVP in particular, writers vote for first through fifth places. 10 points are assigned for a first place vote, 8 points for a second place vote, and so on.\nFollowing the 2015-16 NBA season, Stephen Curry became the first ever unanimous MVP of the league. The most amount of points a player could have gotten that year was 1310 since there were 131 voting media members. The second place finisher, Kawhi Leonard, scored 634 points via some combination of second through fifth place votes. Kawhi’s point total was 48.4% of the total possible points.\nIf we use our imagination, we can think of Kawhi’s season amounting to 48.4% of an MVP season, or 0.484 MVPs. If we sum all of Kawhi’s MVP percentages over his career, he would net an expected 1.16 MVPs.\nI collected data from the 1955-1956 through the 2022-2023 NBA & ABA seasons. For each major NBA/ABA award, we can figure out each player’s expected total. This should not be taken too seriously, but rather be seen as a fun exploration."
